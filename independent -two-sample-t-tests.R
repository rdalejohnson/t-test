# Women's weights
x<- c(38.9, 61.2, 73.3, 21.8, 63.4, 64.6, 48.4, 48.8, 48.5, 43.6)
# Men's weights
y <- c(67.8, 60, 63.4, 76, 89.4, 73.3, 67.3, 61.3, 62.4, 111.2) 


#### Default t-test uses the WELCH T-TEST by default, which is a t-test used when
####  two samples have possibly unequal variances

# can perform an f-test to check if the variances of x and y are equal
var.test(x,y)

#The p-value of the F-test is = 0.8414. Itâ€™s greater than the 
#significance level alpha = 0.05. In conclusion, there is no significant 
#difference between the variances of the two sets of data. 
#Therefore, we can use the classic t-test witch assume equality of the two variances.
